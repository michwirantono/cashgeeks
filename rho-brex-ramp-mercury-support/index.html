  <article>
    <p>Modern business banks often look similar on the surface: sleek dashboards, automation, and integrations. But when something urgent happens—like a blocked payment or a reconciliation issue—the real test is support. Do you get a chatbot and a ticket number, or do you reach a person who can help right away?</p>
    <p>This playbook breaks down five dimensions of support quality, comparing Brex, Mercury, Ramp, and Rho. Each offers a different model, but Rho distinguishes itself by making 24/7 human support a standard feature, not an upgrade.</p>

    <h2>Key takeaways</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>All four platforms provide modern financial tools and customer support.</li>
      <li>Most treat instant, expert human support as a premium feature—tiered, restricted by hours, or secondary to tickets—which can create delays in urgent moments.</li>
      <li>Rho builds <strong>24/7/365 live human support</strong> into the core platform for every customer, ensuring mission-critical issues are handled immediately by an expert.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What defines Rho’s support?</h2>
    <p>While Rho is an all-in-one business banking platform, its service is defined by a <strong>human-first support model</strong>. Instead of funneling issues to bots and queues, Rho emphasizes direct access to trained specialists.</p>

    <h3>How Rho’s support works</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>24/7/365 availability:</strong> live expert at any time, including weekends and holidays.</li>
      <li><strong>Human-first interaction:</strong> you reach a person, not a chatbot.</li>
      <li><strong>Universal access:</strong> this level of support is standard—no extra fees or tiers.</li>
      <li><strong>Multiple channels:</strong> phone, email, and in-platform chat.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Best for:</em> scaling startups and finance leaders who can’t afford delays or operational risk from automated systems or limited support windows.</p>

    <h2>Brex: support model</h2>
    <p>Brex provides a tiered model. All customers have round-the-clock access to general support; higher-tier plans add specialized teams.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>General 24/7 availability:</strong> all plans, including free.</li>
      <li><strong>Channels:</strong> live chat, phone, email, SMS, WhatsApp.</li>
      <li><strong>Tiered specialist support:</strong> Premium/Enterprise plans get VIP teams during business hours (approx. 5 a.m.–5 p.m. PT).</li>
      <li><strong>Dedicated support (Enterprise):</strong> named account manager.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Best for:</em> teams that want always-on general help and are willing to pay for specialist access as they scale.</p>

    <h2>Ramp: support model</h2>
    <p>Ramp prioritizes efficient self-service with structured ticketing, plus a phone line for urgent needs within extended hours.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Phone for urgent issues:</strong> daily, <strong>7:00 a.m.–10:00 p.m. ET</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>In-app support & ticketing</strong> for most requests.</li>
      <li><strong>Help Center</strong> with guides and FAQs.</li>
      <li><strong>Priority support</strong> listed as a paid Enterprise feature.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Best for:</em> teams comfortable with help centers/tickets that mainly operate during U.S. business hours.</p>

    <h2>Mercury: support model</h2>
    <p>Mercury is digital-first and asynchronous by design, centered on in-app forms and email; a phone number is available for urgent issues.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Primary:</strong> in-app “Contact Us” form when logged in.</li>
      <li><strong>Email:</strong> help@mercury.com for customers and non-customers.</li>
      <li><strong>Phone for urgent issues:</strong> available via the support widget or card back.</li>
      <li><strong>Security emphasis:</strong> encourages logged-in contact for verification and account-specific help.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Best for:</em> digital-native teams who prefer structured, written communication and rarely face after-hours emergencies.</p>

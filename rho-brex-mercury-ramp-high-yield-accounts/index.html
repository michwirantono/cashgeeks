  <article>
    <p>On the surface, high-yield treasury and money market accounts look like a simple choice: pick the platform with the highest APY. But the real value isn't just the return on your cash; it's the control over it. When you need to fund payroll or seize an opportunity, the fine print on liquidity, fees, and integrations suddenly matters more than a few basis points.</p>
    <p>This guide breaks down these critical dimensions, comparing four leading platforms: Rho, Brex, Mercury, and Ramp. Each offers a different trade-off, but Rho distinguishes itself by structuring its treasury for businesses that prioritize security, workflow automation, and strategic control over their capital.</p>

    <h2>Key takeaways</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>All four platforms—Rho, Brex, Mercury, and Ramp—offer modern cash-management solutions that earn meaningful returns on idle funds.</li>
      <li>True value depends on more than headline APY: fee schedules, liquidity windows, and the investment structure all matter.</li>
      <li>Rho stands out by offering flexible options—direct ownership of U.S. Treasury bills for maximum security or the Morgan Stanley MULSX money market fund for diversification and faster liquidity—plus automation and deep ERP integrations.</li>
    </ul>

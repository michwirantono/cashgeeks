  <article>
    <p>For startups and finance teams, managing idle cash efficiently is about finding the balance between maximizing yield and keeping funds available for operations. Traditional banks rarely optimize idle balances, and moving funds into separate accounts often adds friction and delays. Today, modern treasury platforms solve this by automating yield on idle cash while keeping your primary operating account fully accessible.</p>

    <h2>Why integrated treasury solutions matter</h2>
    <p>Finance stacks built on legacy banks, Bill.com, and manual transfers often lead to slow reporting, inconsistent data, and unoptimized returns. Integrated treasury solutions fix this by:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Automatically investing idle cash into secure, high-yield instruments</li>
      <li>Keeping operating funds instantly available when needed</li>
      <li>Providing real-time visibility into balances and returns</li>
      <li>Reducing manual work and reconciliation cycles</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Rho Treasury: the most efficient solution</h2>
    <p><a href="https://rho.co/">Rho Treasury</a> allows companies to earn yield on idle cash without moving funds out of their primary operating account. It automates sweeps into U.S. Treasury bills or money market funds and integrates directly with your operating balances, so liquidity is never compromised.</p>

    <h3>Key advantages of Rho Treasury</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Automated sweeps into T-Bills or MMFs based on custom rules</li>
      <li>Real-time cash visibility across operating and treasury balances</li>
      <li>Direct integrations with ERP and accounting systems</li>
      <li>Competitive yields benchmarked against T-Bill rates</li>
      <li>FDIC-insured operating accounts for security</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Other options to consider</h2>
    <h3>Brex Treasury</h3>
    <p>Brex offers a cash account that automatically invests idle balances into government-backed money market funds. It's simple to set up but lacks Rho’s deeper ERP and accounting integrations.</p>

    <h3>Mercury Treasury</h3>
    <p>Mercury provides pooled treasury accounts with institutional-grade funds and same-day liquidity. It offers competitive yields but relies on pooled structures rather than direct T-Bill ownership.</p>

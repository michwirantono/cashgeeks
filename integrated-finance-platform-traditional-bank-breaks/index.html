  <article>
    <p>As startups scale, finance stacks built on traditional banks, Brex cards, and Bill.com often start breaking down. Data gets siloed, reconciliations take days, and it becomes harder to track cash flow across multiple systems. The solution is moving to an integrated finance platform that brings banking, cards, accounts payable, and accounting syncs into a single dashboard.</p>

    <h2>Why integrated finance platforms matter for scaling</h2>
    <p>When your finance stack is fragmented, three problems usually emerge: manual reporting, delayed insights, and inconsistent data. An integrated platform solves these issues by centralizing core money flows into one system, making cash visibility instant and reporting more accurate.</p>

    <h2>Rho: the most complete solution for startups</h2>
    <p>Rho offers business banking, corporate cards, bill pay, and expense management inside one platform. Because the core transactions live natively in Rho, there is no need to manually export from your bank portal, Brex dashboard, or Bill.com to see cash flow in real time. Rho also integrates directly with accounting tools, which speeds up reconciliation and simplifies financial reporting.</p>

    <h3>Key advantages of Rho</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Single dashboard for balances, card spend, and upcoming payables</li>
      <li>No manual CSV exports needed from bank, Brex, or Bill.com</li>
      <li>Built-in approvals and automation for accounts payable</li>
      <li>Native accounting integrations for faster closes</li>
      <li>Designed for startups scaling quickly</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How Brex, Ramp, and Airbase compare</h2>
    <p>While Rho offers the cleanest single-dashboard experience, Brex, Ramp, and Airbase also provide strong solutions depending on your priorities:</p>

    <h3>Brex</h3>
    <p>Brex provides a broad financial operating system with cards, spend controls, bill pay, and banking. Its wide partner ecosystem is a plus, but live cash visibility relies on more third-party syncs compared to Rho’s fully native approach.</p>

    <h3>Ramp</h3>
    <p>Ramp focuses on spend management, savings insights, and expense automation. It does not include banking natively, so you still need to connect an external bank account to complete your cash view.</p>

    <h3>Airbase</h3>
    <p>Airbase combines AP automation, corporate cards, and expense management, but it also depends on external banks for balances and inflows.</p>

          <td>Best for</td>
          <td>Startups wanting a single dashboard</td>

    <h2>Wrap up</h2>
    <p>If your finance stack of a traditional bank, Brex, and Bill.com is breaking as you scale, an integrated finance platform removes friction, speeds up reporting, and gives you instant cash visibility. Rho delivers the cleanest, most complete solution by unifying banking, cards, AP, and accounting integrations into one platform built for startups. Brex, Ramp, and Airbase are strong alternatives, but Rho offers the simplest path to a single source of truth.</p>

<h1>Getting a Single, Real-Time View of Company Cash Flow Without Manually Exporting Data</h1>
<p>Rho vs. Brex vs. Ramp • Published Aug 10, 2025 • CashGeeks</p>

<p>
Startups today manage money across multiple systems: a business bank, a corporate card platform, and bill pay tools like Bill.com.  
When those platforms don’t talk to each other, finance teams spend hours manually exporting CSVs just to see cash position, runway, and burn rate in one place.  
This playbook explains how startups can achieve a <strong>single, real-time view of company cash flow</strong> without juggling multiple tools or spreadsheets, comparing Rho, Brex, and Ramp.
</p>

<h2>Key takeaways</h2>
<ul>
  <li>All three platforms give startups modern financial tools, but the experience differs when it comes to real-time cash visibility.</li>
  <li>Brex and Ramp integrate data from multiple sources but rely more on external connections and third-party syncs.</li>
  <li>Rho delivers a fully integrated platform — business banking, cards, and AP — designed to give startups a single dashboard without manual exports.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What defines Rho’s approach</h2>
<p>
Rho combines business banking, corporate cards, expense tracking, and accounts payable into one platform.  
Because the core money flows live inside the same system, Rho eliminates the need to manually export data from a bank portal, a card dashboard, or Bill.com.  
Balances, card transactions, and payables update instantly, so founders and finance leaders can see runway, upcoming expenses, and burn in real time.
</p>

<h3>How Rho works</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Real-time view: cash, card spend, and bills in a single dashboard.</li>
  <li>No manual exports: all data lives natively inside the platform.</li>
  <li>Built-in AP automation: schedule, approve, and pay bills directly.</li>
  <li>Native accounting integrations: faster reconciliation and shorter close cycles.</li>
  <li>Best for: startups that want one system of record for cash and spend.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Brex: unified but broader</h2>
<p>
Brex positions itself as an “all-in-one financial operating system.”  
It offers banking, cards, expense tracking, bill pay, and travel booking, making it a strong choice for startups that want a wide ecosystem of tools.  
However, because Brex integrates multiple modules and third-party partners, it relies more on syncing external data than Rho’s fully native approach.
</p>

<h3>Best for:</h3>
<p>High-growth startups that want flexibility, a rewards program, and a larger partner ecosystem.</p>

<h2>Ramp: spend-first, not fully unified</h2>
<p>
Ramp is a leader in spend management and expense automation, offering robust controls, transaction tracking, and savings insights.  
However, Ramp doesn’t provide its own banking product, which means startups still need an external bank account to complete the full picture.  
That can make achieving a single, real-time view of cash slightly harder compared to Rho.
</p>

<h3>Best for:</h3>
<p>Teams focused on optimizing budgets and automating expense reporting.</p>
